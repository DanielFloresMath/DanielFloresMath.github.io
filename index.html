	<div class="section-header">About Me</div>
	<div class="section-content" id="about-me">
    	<p>My name is Daniel Flores. I was born in Mexico City and embarked on a life-altering journey to the United States as a first-generation immigrant at the age of four. Growing up as a Dreamer, I faced unique challenges that have profoundly shaped my worldview and aspirations. These experiences have instilled in me a unique perspective and an unwavering dedication to my academic pursuits.</p>

    	<p>I began my academic journey in Houston, Texas, where I earned an Associate of Science degree from Lone Star College in 2016. Driven by an emerging fascination with mathematics, I continued my education at the University of Houston, graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics in 2019. It was during this period that I found myself particularly drawn to number theory.</p>

    	<p>I'm currently in my fifth year as a Ph.D. student at Purdue University, studying under Professor Trevor Wooley. My research interests include analytic number theory, the Hardy-Littlewood circle method, harmonic analysis, and arithmetic statistics, among others. I appreciate the meticulous work involved in achieving results in these areas and aspire to make a meaningful contribution through my research.</p>

    	<p>Outside the realm of mathematics, I deeply value the time spent with my wife and son, as it brings balance and motivation to my life. I also unwind with PC gaming, a welcome distraction that helps me decompress, especially when I need a break from intensive mathematical thinking. Additionally, I enjoy playing the trumpet with the Purdue concert band. It's not only a creative outlet for me but also a continual challenge that inspires me to better myself.</p>

    	<p>Thank you for taking the time to visit my page and learn about my journey, both academic and personal. I aim to progress in my career and, drawing from my own experiences, to offer support and inspiration to others facing challenges in immigration and education.</p>
